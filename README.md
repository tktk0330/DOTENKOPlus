# UI Design

![Screenshot 2024-10-05 at 12 34 08](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e3f78c8-5632-483c-ae95-6f55227e5005)

The UI design was created using Figma. Advanced animations made with After Effects were implemented for each action. We aimed to replicate the appearance of the card hands as realistically as possible, and the Joker was given a special glow to emphasize its rarity.
